# About
This repo exists to demonstrate visually how different algorithms function.

# Architecture 
I made the decision to make this repo as minimal as possible: no bundling, no modules, a functional TypeScript framework which uses the TypeScript and SCSS compilers to generate vanilla JavaScript and CSS.

# Testing
To view the test suites for this repo follow the setup steps then open the tests directory and view the test.html file in browser.
Tests are written in vanilla JavaScript to maintain the no module / functional philosophy.

# Setup
* Clone or download repo
* From root directory run the following:
```
npm install
npm run build
```
* Open build/index.html in browser
